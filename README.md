# Pezeshkino

This app is greatly inspired by paziresh24.ir, nobat24.ir, and nobat.ir. The problem this app aims to solve is directly connecting the patients with the doctors. This app tries to solve this by letting the user ask and pay for appointments online, submitting the reviews of the doctor, and also this app is going to let users ask for an online visit with their doctor through social media.
